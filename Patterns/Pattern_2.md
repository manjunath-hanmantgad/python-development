Module Pattern:
The Module pattern allows you to encapsulate private and public members within a module, enabling you to create self-contained and reusable code units. This pattern is particularly useful in languages like JavaScript, where modules are not natively supported.

Factory Pattern:
The Factory pattern promotes modularity by encapsulating object creation. Factories create objects based on certain conditions or configurations, allowing you to centralize object creation logic. This approach enhances modularity by isolating the instantiation process.

Decorator Pattern:
The Decorator pattern enhances modularity by allowing behavior to be added to individual objects without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. Decorators provide a flexible way to modify the functionality of classes at runtime, promoting modularity and code reusability.

Composite Pattern:
The Composite pattern promotes modularity by allowing you to treat both individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. It enables you to create tree structures where individual objects and compositions of objects share a common interface. This pattern is useful when dealing with hierarchies of components.

Observer Pattern:
The Observer pattern enhances modularity by decoupling the sender (subject) and receivers (observers) of messages. Observers can be added or removed without modifying the subject. This modularity allows you to create loosely coupled systems where components can be easily added or removed.

Strategy Pattern:
The Strategy pattern promotes modularity by encapsulating algorithms and allowing them to be selected at runtime. By separating the algorithms from the context that uses them, you can easily swap out algorithms without modifying the context. This pattern allows for modularity in algorithm implementations.

Command Pattern:
The Command pattern enhances modularity by encapsulating requests as objects. Commands decouple sender and receiver objects, allowing you to parameterize objects with operations. This modularity enables the implementation of undo, redo, and queueing operations.

Dependency Injection Pattern:
The Dependency Injection pattern promotes modularity by injecting dependencies (such as services, objects, or configuration settings) into components rather than allowing components to create their dependencies. This approach simplifies testing, enhances flexibility, and allows components to be more modular and reusable.
