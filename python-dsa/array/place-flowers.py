The function canPlaceFlowers takes two parameters: flowerbed (a list representing the flowerbed with planted and unplanted plots) and n (the number of flowers you want to plant).

We store the length of the flowerbed list in the variable length.

We initialize a variable count to keep track of the number of flowers that can be planted and set it to 0.

We initialize a variable i to 0, which will be used as an index to traverse the flowerbed list.

We enter a while loop that runs until i reaches the end of the flowerbed list.

Inside the loop, we check if the current plot at index i is empty (equal to 0) and if the previous plot (if it exists) and the next plot (if it exists) are also empty. This condition ensures that flowers can be planted in the current plot without violating the adjacent plot rule.

If the condition is satisfied, we set the current plot to 1 to indicate that a flower has been planted, and we increment the count by 1.

We then increment i by 1 to move to the next plot in the flowerbed list.

After the loop finishes, we check if the number of planted flowers, count, is greater than or equal to the required number of flowers, n. If it is, we return True; otherwise, we return False.

The solution has a time complexity of O(N), where N is the length of the flowerbed list. This is because we traverse the flowerbed list once, checking each plot's eligibility for planting flowers. The loop iterates through each plot exactly once, so the time complexity is linear.
